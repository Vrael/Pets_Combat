# Combat pets

This is an application where you can manage users and create pets for an epic combat between them.

## Usage

Visit http://localhost:3000/admin for manage users

First time could be necessary create an Admin:

```ruby
rails c
AdminUser.create!(:email => 'admin@example.com', :password => 'password', :password_confirmation => 'password')
```  

## API

Type | URL | Params | Explanation
---| --- | --- | ---
POST|`/api/pets`| name,age,gender,kind | Create a pet
GET |`/api/pets/:id`| :id | Returns a pet by id
PUT |`/api/pets/:id`| name,age,gender,kind | Update a pet
DELETE |`/api/pets/:id`| :id | Delete a pet by id
POST|`/api/combat`| pet1_id,pet2_id,datetime | Create a combat

POST, PUT and DELETE methods need an additional parameter `access_token` which is the token generated by system first time an user is registered. You can display its value from Active Admin

It is pending to create a batch process that determines the result of the fighting and update ratios pets.
